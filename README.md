# PYTHON LEARNING TRACKER + QUIZ WEBSITE

This project was developed as a final project for GS 497 – Python App at BYU-Idaho prior to my graduation. 
Its goal was to help deepen my understanding of back-end development using Python and Flask, 
as well as reinforce foundational front-end skills using HTML, CSS, and basic web design.

# Python Learning Tracker + Quiz App is a simple and interactive web application that allows users to:
- Set and manage their Python learning goals
- Take multiple-choice quizzes on Python topics
- Receive instant scoring and feedback
- Track past quiz attempts with dates and scores

The project helped me apply concepts in data persistence, route handling with Flask, 
dynamic content rendering, and basic styling. It simulates the type of full-stack thinking expected 
in professional software development — combining user interface, logic, and data storage.


# FEATURES

- Add, view, and manage learning goals  
- Take interactive Python quizzes  
- Get immediate scoring and feedback  
- Track quiz history with dates and scores  
- Clean web interface using Flask and Jinja templates  


# DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENT

- Visual Studio Code
- Python 3.13
- Flask (Python micro-framework)
- Git & GitHub

# LANGUAGES & TOOLS USED:

- Python 3 (main programming language)
- HTML5 (Jinja2 templates)
- CSS3 (basic styling)
- JSON (data storage)
- Flask (for web server and routing)


# HOW TO RUN THE APP

1. Install dependencies (Flask)  
   Open a terminal and run:
   pip install flask

2. Navigate to the project folder:
   cd "C:\Users\bruno\Desktop\Current Semester\GS 497\Final Project - Quiz Python App"

3. Run the app:
   python app.py

4. Open your browser and visit:
   http://127.0.0.1:5000
